## Requirements

The Frame iOS SDK requires Xcode 15 or later and is compatible with apps targeting iOS 17 or above. We support Catalyst on macOS 11 or later.

For iOS 12 support, please use [v22.8.4](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/tree/v22.8.4). For iOS 11 support, please use [v21.13.0](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/tree/v21.13.0). For iOS 10, please use [v19.4.0](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/tree/v19.4.0). If you need to support iOS 9, use [v17.0.2](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/tree/v17.0.2).


## Features

**Simplified security**: We make it simple for you to collect sensitive data such as credit card numbers and remain [PCI compliant](https://stripe.com/docs/security#pci-dss-guidelines). This means the sensitive data is sent directly to Stripe instead of passing through your server. For more information, see our [integration security guide](https://stripe.com/docs/security).

**Apple Pay**: [StripeApplePay](StripeApplePay/README.md) provides a [seamless integration with Apple Pay](https://stripe.com/docs/apple-pay).
